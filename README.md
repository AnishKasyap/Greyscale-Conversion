# Greyscale-Conversion
Grayscaling is process by which an image is converted from a full color to shades of grey (black & white)
In OpenCV, many functions grayscale images before processing. This is done because it simplifies the image, acting almost as a noise reduction and increasing processing time as there is less information in the image.
